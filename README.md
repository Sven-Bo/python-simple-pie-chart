# Create A Pie Chart In Python Using Plotly & Excel

Did you know you can use Python code to create a pie chart? This is a tutorial that will show you how to create one using Python. For this particular tutorial, we will be using Plotly & Excel.

You can do all the changes in the excel file and after running the script again you will have your updated pie chart.

The Pie Chart is also interactive. If you hover over the chart, you will see the percent share for each category and you can even hide/unhide certain categories dynamically. The final chart will be also saved in a HTML file. Hence, you could also send the chart to your friends & colleagues, who do not even need to have Python installed on their machines.

This tutorial is focusing on beginners in Python. Even you have never written a single line of code in Python, you will be able to have your pie chart by the end of this tutorial.
